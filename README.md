# SpiderIsland 25-key RGB Backlight Hot Swap Mechanical Keyboard

This is a reupload of a failed pull request by user Jereksel, I did not develop this configuration.

Keyboard from [SpiderIsland on AliExpress](https://a.aliexpress.com/_dVJsSpR). Seller provides [kbfirmware](https://kbfirmware.com/) JSON config that was converted to QMK.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [jereksel](https://github.com/jereksel)
* Hardware Availability: https://aliexpress.com/item/1005001523579896.html

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make spiderisland/winry25tc:default

**Reset Key**: Located on the other side of the keyboard.

## Newbs:
I don't know a great deal about QMK keyboards, their configurations, nor VIA.  However, I have been provided with files over time that others have found useful.

Within the `Other` folder, there is a .hex and a .json VIA config file for this keyboard (either with or without the RGB capabilities).
